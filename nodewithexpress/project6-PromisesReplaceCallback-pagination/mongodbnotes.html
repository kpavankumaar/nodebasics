Mongo db
Relational database (SQL) 			Document Database (No Sql)
====================================================
Server							Server
Database 						Database
Tables 							Collections
Row 							Document
Columns							Field


Mongo db saves data in Object format 
Document is a javascript  Object 
{
	id: 1 , 
	brand: ’nokia' 
},
{
	id: 2 , 
	brand: ’samsung’,
	orders: [{date: 1/1/2000, qty:2},{date: 1/1/2000, qty:1},{date: 1/1/2000, qty:4}],
	reviews: [{},{},{}]
}

If you have more than one object we call it as Collections
And how do we save data in relational world

Relational database 
=============================
Id 	brand 	model 	price
1 	nokia  	s7 		3000


Orders
===============================
productId 	Date 		Qty
1 			1/1/2008 		2
1 			1/1/2008 		1
1 			1/1/2008 		4
1 			1/1/2008 		2

Specifications
===============================
productId  RAM


Reviews 
=============================
productId 


to fetch one product information we have to join these many tables 







Another thing is in any programming language we deal with objects we dont deal with rows and columns 

so object from java or any programming language has to transformed into tables 
and while retrieving , you will retrieve the rows and columns and convert that into an object .
In case of mongodb we retrieve the document and use it . and there is no need for transformation 

running mongo server in the background
to start mongo db server in windows 
command for cli is 

	-- net start mongodb 
to stop mongo db server in windows 
	-- net stop mongodb





mongodb basic introduction 
to communicate between node and db 
we need to have driver 

so we install mongoose

documents can have any key value pairs and  to enforce certain structure at the application level instead of database level

if you know what is hibernate in java . Mongoose is similar to hibernate 
Hibernate is ORM 
you have java Object, Relational database table, and you are Mapping it 

Here we have Object Document Mapper (Object is a javascript Object, Document here is a object in mongodb,and Mappper );
Mongoose is called ODM

using mongoose is simple -> npm install mongoose

let mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017", () => console.log("db connected"));

"mongodb://localhost:27017" -- along with this information you may have to give username and password for cloud
27017 is the default port 

without the port number also it will work .
mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost/dl-products", () => console.log("db connected"));


this is only to test for creating the database on the fly as dl-products collection will be created if it already doesnot exist 
// testing
In Robo3t 
commands -> 

	show collections 
	db.movies.insert({name :'god father',rating:9.2})


movies database is created 
mention the port number 
dl-products -> name of the database doesnot matter if db exists or not 

and when we say "use db " if the database doesnot exist database is created

--------------------------------------------------
now in the project structure 
create directory named models 
in models directory -> create product.model.js

in index.js 
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
module.exports = mongoose.model("product", {
	brand:String,
	model:String,
	price:Number,
	inStock:boolean

})

// first parameter is name of the model  and second parameter is the structure 

 brand:String,
	model:String,
	price:Number,
	inStock:boolean

only these above fields will be saved in database and if we send more fields they are all discarded 


now import the product.model into middleware function in our project we import this into product.ctrl

const product = require('product.model');
const productCtrl = {
	get : (req,res)=>{
		// asyncronous operation
		product.find(function(products,err){
 			res.status(200);
 			res.json(products);
 		}) 
 	},
};


product.find() // this statement is enough to search a collection as we are connection through mongoose.connect() to a database collections
